# movies-review-service (MRS)
A movie review API that provides information about the latest movie releases, reviews, ratings, and recommendations.

## MRS Solution design overview
Developing a movie review service that provides information about the latest movie releases, reviews, ratings, and recommendations can be an exciting project. Here's a high-level outline of the steps you can follow to implement the desired features:

* Data Modeling: Design the data models for your application. This might include entities like Movie, Genre, Actor, Review, Rating, and any other related entities you may need. Consider the relationships between these entities.
* Data Source Selection: Choose a movie database or API that provides movie information, including details like titles, release dates, genres, cast, and reviews. Popular options include IMDb API, The Movie Database (TMDb), or OMDb API. Register for an API key and familiarize yourself with their documentation.
* Integration with Movie Database API: Integrate your application with the chosen movie database API. Implement functionality to fetch movie details, including plot summaries, cast information, and user reviews.
* Latest Movie Releases: Display information about the latest movie releases, including release dates, genres, and ratings. Use the movie database API to retrieve and present this information.
* Movie Reviews: Retrieve and display movie reviews from users or critics. Allow users to rate and review movies. Implement functionality to sort reviews based on ratings, popularity, or recency.
* Movie Ratings: Provide average ratings for movies based on user reviews. Implement functionality to calculate and display movie ratings based on user inputs.
* Movie Recommendations: Offer personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences, ratings, or viewing history. Implement recommendation algorithms or collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies that align with users' tastes.
* User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for your movie review service. You can create a web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Alternatively, develop a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
* User Management: Implement user registration, login, and authentication functionality. Use Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization. Include features like user profiles, favorite movies, watchlists, and the ability to submit reviews and ratings.
* Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of your application. You can use tools like JUnit and Mockito for testing in Spring Boot.
* Deployment: Deploy your application to a hosting platform or a cloud provider. You can use services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for deployment.

Ensure that you comply with any legal and licensing requirements for using movie data, adhere to the terms of the chosen movie database API, and handle user information securely.

This outline should provide you with a starting point for developing your Movie Review Service. Make sure to explore Spring Boot documentation and the documentation of the movie database API you integrate with for detailed implementation guidance. Enjoy creating your movie-centric platform!
